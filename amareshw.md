# Music Player Application + First PC Build

## Summary

i got to know about about term programming for the first time when my sister joined a programming course.
I wanted to know what it actually is, so i consulted with her , after knowing that with programming we can 
develop application and websites, i  also wanted to learn this due to lack of resources, i was not 
able to learn it.But When my sister told me we could possibly build a pc and develop a application in it.
My interest for this again sparked up.Even though i know little about it, my sister will help me in this
 project as she knows a lot more than me.I think this project will be a wonderful opportunity for me and 
my sister to learn a lot about application development.i am very much excited for this. I will be completing 
the project with @santoshiUser.


## Plan
To build a PC, first of all, we will figure out what parts we need to build PC from our teacher.
This PC build will require no special skills, we just need parts to put together.
we will be guided my our techer how to assemble the Parts we picked up.After the build is 
completed,Then We will install the operating system in it, from a bootable pendrive.We will then check
everything is working fine in it. if it is working fine the build will be complete.
For the music player app first we need to download and install a android studio.then we will download the SDK required for 
the libraries that help in developing a application.After the android studio is done, Then we will 
make music player application by the help of documentaion of Google for android and guidance from teacher who have good 
experience in building application.

In this way, we are going to complete Music player application and our First PC build.
